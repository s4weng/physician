Dr. Burke does not listen to the parents concerns with it comes to their children. We started seeing her when my daughter was first born. After crying out to her several times about concerning issues with my daughter I finally went against her will and took her to the ER. My daughter had a severe medical problem. I even had the ER doctor and nurses question me if I had ever taken my daughter to a doctor since her health was so severe. I did and we actually saw Dr. Burke several days before the incident and called her the day of the ER visit. My daughter spent a week in the hospital and we never saw Dr. Burke one time. I would not ever recommend Dr. Burke to anyone!

Went a day early to fill out all the paper work. Spent two and a half hours filling out all the forms and was then told by the office staff who were very polite that the good doctor will not operate on someone who has had previous surgery and still has any metal in their back. Never met the doctor. Very disappointed. Prior to learning I was not an acceptable patient I was told it would take at least a week or two before I would hear back from the good doc. It would be based on priority. I gave low ratings due to not being given prior notice the good doc does not like to do work behind others. My original surgery was 12 years ago. The staff was kind enough to give a list of Tampa doctors who might do what he would not do....try to help me.

At 10:00am I was still sitting in the waiting room waiting to be seen. About 8 people had came in after me and they were all called to the back within 10 minutes of being there. I had to leave because I had another appointment to be at 11:00 and I didn't want to be late. I asked them if I could come back later that evening and that said no. This was EXTREMELY frustrating to me because I took off work to attend this appointment.

Third round with this doctor because of his mistakes which included wound opening and infection.Makes excuses to avoid post operation care. Schedules over 17 patients(standing room only) for appointments and then shows up at 3PM or later. Office is not prepared with surgical equipment and there is no assistant. Always disgruntled patients during visits. To avoid these problems if possible stay away from the emergency room at Coral Gables Hospital.

My Wife took our 2-year old son to get a check up since in the past he had surgery due to a hernia. So my wife tells me that this doctor proceeded to to tell here how a two year old child should be handled. I thought Doctors where supose to make kids feel at eas Not scare them and Make them Cry Maybe this doctor has been working to many years to many long hours. Or maybe he likes to be mean and tough in front of women and their children becouse i dought that he would ack this way if the father was present. So let me tell you what happened Our two year old son is like any other two year old cant sit still and wont listen So this doctor tells my wife let me show you how you control a two year old and grabs our son forces him down on the bed pushing and squeezing him down and then proceeded to pick him up and hold him in a bar hug. So my wife told him in a loud voice let go of my son and took our son and left.I will tell you that due to this we will look for health care somwhere else and I am sure that that this is not the only incident that this doctor has So I will look and I am sure I will find more people that have experienced this doctors inexperience of dealing with children as patients. Aslo keep in Mind that he was more focused on controling our son then trying to find out why our son was their in the first place.

Handman claimed the lump on my left side was an mematoma. The lump was lanced open approximately 6 inches and I was told it would heal from the inside out. After 2 to 3 weeks a wound care nurse red flag emailed Handman telling him there was a problem with the wound and said he would see me at my appointment with the physician assistant wound care specialists of which he failed to show. Two weeks after that another surgeon at Kaiser was summoned by the PA because she felt something was wrong and the new sugeon agreed. I was scheduled for surgery to remove the open lump that had grown bigger than a golf ball that night and had 6 1/2 inches of my side removed. Since this began other lumps formed throughout my body but was diagnosed as lipomas. Four days later I was told by phone from my urologist that I had been diagnosed with (Stage 4) non hodgkins lymphoma. I was left with an open malignant tumor for 7 weeks with at least 3 other tumors surfacing. Dr. Handman was noticed on more than one occasion that something was wrong and did nothing putting my life at risk. Handman and Kaiser provided me with a low standard of care.

"DO NOT USE THIS MAN!!!!! He was 1 1/2 hours late for an out patient procedure. As I waited in hall way of Scripps Encinitas short stay unit I listened to fumed Surgeons who had to postpone their surgerys until he got there. After my nerves were shot watching patients come in and out of surgerys Ghosh arrived and was extremely rushed as he said ''''he was stuck in traffic!"" After my 20 minn Procedure i woke up in severe pain. I told him I felt as though I was blowing up inside and was screaming in pain! I was not beleived & was given pain meds to knock me out so i would stop screaming! He took 6 hours to do a CT Scan only because my vitals dropped so badly I ended up in ICU! My husband was supposed to return in an hour and a half to pick me up. It was nearly impossible for him to figure out through staff what happened to me as staff in short stay could not get a hold of DR Ghosh and my 2 year old was with my husband so he could not go anywhere else in the Hospital! After CT Scan it turns out Dr Ghosh nicked artries during my procedure and I was bleeding backwards internally! Spent days in ICU with a scarry procedure to repair damage then days in hospital healing. My Hematoma was so large that I was in horrible pain for months and so sick from meds and blood transfusion. His bedside manner was nice after the whole thing happened but i heard him twice yelling at the head nurse as they had a very difficult time getting a hold of him. Lets just say i beleived the nurses. This has left my daughter extremely insecure and she still remembers this even though she was only almost 3. Hopefully this helps you make a clear decission!"

"Stay away from Dr. Tracy! He will do whatever he can to keep from referring you to a specialist and will always suggest doing nothing when it comes to preventative medicine and testing. He suggested that I have a PSA test only once every few years because there were ""too many false positives"". I ignored his advice and had a PSA test done every year. A few months after his dangerous ""advice"" my PSA began to rise. After 6 months it continued to go up. I had a biopsy which showed some aggressive cancer in the prostate and had surgery 2 weeks ago. The surgery was very successful. If I had taken Dr. Tracy's advice and waited 2-3 years for the next PSA test I would definitely have had stage 4 cancer and a very grim prognosis. This was not the first time he made a bad diagnosis with me but it was the last since I left Kaiser Permanente after the PSA incident. He also resisted referring my wife for a colonoscopy even though she has a family history of colon cancer. I highly recommend avoiding Dr. Tracy if you value your health."

at first i was somewhat satisfied with this doctor.however everything turned sour when she told me to stop using my wash and use a corrosive soap instead stating it was giving me the vaginal infections she was treating me for.the soap gave me severe clitoris pain and swelling which i am still suffering to this day.she refused to prescribe anything to ease the pain.after three weeks of begging her she prescribed lidocaine.when i had concerns of that med since it was going on my clitoris and another procedure she wanted me to do she told me in a rude way to find another doctor.she made my problems even worse because she should of known about the corrosive ingriedients in the soap.

My wife was her patient and had a miscarriage when we were vacationing. We went in vacation with her approval that is safe to travel during that pregnancy period. After the miscarriage my wife called TWICE her office to let her know what happened. She call back after 3 DAYS! What kind of doctor waits 3 days to check upon her patient who had a traumatizing experience as a miscarriage?

 I have great insurance and didn't waste a lot of money. I'm not a negative person and I have only stated facts. I'm sure she is a good person and hopefully has been able to help other people. I just wanted to put this out there because knowing what I know now I would have looked harder for a doctor. Good luck to anyone else searching for a good back doctor."
 was I ready to schedule. I told the nurse that I'd really like to leave a message for the doc to call me and she told me that ""Dr. Tibiletti doesn't make personal phone calls."" If I needed to ask her a question I would have to schedule an appt. I will schedule one more appt. with the doctor but it will be the last. Luckily

We have been going to this doctor since the birth of my son. Now 14 month old. We never wait less than an hour to be seen. Last time my son had over 103 fever. I told them. They told me to come in and then made me wait over 2.5 hours. This was an emergency... Anyways once dr. Hubsch comes in (after you already tell everything a student that's there) you are out in no time... However he never listens... This last visit was the last straw. We will never ever go back there. Also he never calls back unless you keep calling 3-5 times and ask to speak to him about a situation he told you to call him about. Once it took a week and me going to the office to be able to speak to him.

After a LOT of rehabilitation and another surgery by another doctor and another medical institution my knee is now at 30 to 40 percent. By the way with Ochsner when you complain too much to your doctor ""Dr Mongomery"" about the surgery making your knee worse they write you a letter telling you that you are no longer wanted or allowed to use Ochsner ever again. Yes this really happened. After Dr Montgomery told me that if I don't stop causing trouble he will no longer be able to treat me.

This doctor nicked my elderly mothers bowel and never told us what he had done. We have tried to work with him about a settlement since she was bed ridden after his operation that was to be an outpatient op. He did other work on her without our approval. In fact we specifically told him not to do the second operation and he did it anyway. We got her records and found out and confronted him after trying to talk with him for a long time and then he admitted he had an accident while doing the surgery. My mother was in and out of hospitals for months and the doctor feels no obligation to turn it into his insurance. In fact he feels no obligation to his patient for his mistake sine he repaired it. I would never suggest using this doctor as it appears to us he really doesn't care about damage he does while operating.

This is not someone I would consider a Dr really -- she is a Referral Specialist -- on my first visit and expression of limited income she still tried to send me to about 5 specialist for condition diagnosed and maintained well for 10 years. As a person with a chronic pain disorder I was horrified by her lack of compassion or empathy. She openly speaks to absolutely not perscribing Benzos or Pain meds -yet also refuses non narcotic meds- but suggested at least 5 anti depressants - Depression is not my diagnosis. Most people need a DR that is adept at patient CARE -- not one that wishes to refer you to specialist after specialist to avoid reviewing your previous health records that contain documented diagnosis. I also didn't appreciate the sales pitch that ObamaCare would solve all my health care woes

How can you sleep at night when you know what you have done?I hope you see her face when you wake up at night... and remember her voice.I pray you never have a doctor caring for you in the manner that you cared for her... you won't live through it if you have a doctor like you.

He delivered my first child and is not a very good listener. He didn't seem to care that I wanted to explore options other than a c-section. He had a rather disapproving demeanor during the entire delivery. I also had a large amount of placenta left in my uterus that required surgery 2 weeks later.

She was the worst doctor I have ever experienced in life. She didn't listen to my concerns and took it very lightly when I know I am clearly in pain. She doesn't know my body. I had several appointments where I felt like she was trying to rush me out rather than know my concerns and take her time. She seems selfish and very apathetic. When I switched the another doctor everything checked out fine and got my correct diagnosis. I would never recommend her to anyone.

This MD is only interested in the money he makes from herding you in to his office like cattle. His staff were rude and deceived me into thinking that my insurance would cover the visit. One month later I found out that this MD charged me over $400.00 for a routine visit and I was stuck paying the bill. When I called to find out why his very rude office staff manager started screaming at me and told me it was my fault! When I tried to communicate to the MD about this he ignored my fax and the letter I wrote him.And besides all the frustration I experienced he did not help me medically at all!Bottom line is he does not care about you. Find an MD that will.

"He does not listen to the patient. Told him I had tightness & numbness in both hands and arms and across my chest. On his questionnaire for chest pain I deleted the word pain and inserted numbness and tightness. In the letter sent to me from his office he states ""chest pain as the reason for my visit and his diagnoses was 1. Chest pain unspecified. 2. Tobacco abuse. There was no test done that showed tobacco caused the symptoms I was having. In my humble opinion this man wrote what the Insurance Lobby would like to see rather than what I told him my symptoms were and what his test showed. The test he has conducted on me thus far have shown nothing wrong with my cardiovascular system. This could turn out a neurological problem caused by who knows what but my primary care Doctor said the heart and veins should be checked first. I would not recommend this Doctor."

I was recently discharged for voicing my opinion about my care. I am in extremely pain and awaighting surgery .

Please assign me a new doctor and help me. I have done nothing to deserve this and it is a violation of you're hepacratic oath you took as doctors to not turn away those in pain and destress. Especially when they get scheduled for surgery by Dr. Staciu at argone family medical clinic in valley. I've been told that sence you discharged me I wount be able to get in anywhere and my file is marked..that has happened before and been a huge huddle or block in the road for me getting the help I need. I am so tierd of fighting for help! The records show how hard I'm trying to get to be the best I can be. Adapt to my limitations and overcome but I can't do that without my pain being managed in the healthiest way possible sence I've been told time and again by st Luke's that I'm going to be this way the rest of my life so I do not want to put six hydrocodone a day in my body I don't want to hurt my liver.

My appointment with this OBGYN was a waste of time. Literature about women's issues were no where to be found in this OBGYN's office. I had to wait forever after I arrived for my appointment. They were running really behind and I was disappointed because it threw off the rest of my day. It seems Mr. Mercado if we can call him a doctor has a self esteem issue. He wants to show his superiority and tries to belittle you. I spoke to him in English and told him what procedures I previously underwent. He told me what I explained to him was wrong and that I should speak Spanish with him because I don't understand the English language. Wow what a professional. Instead of trying to help me with my medical condition he was more concerned about the language I spoke with him.

Misdiagnosed my shoulder injury. Even after the MRI results came in showing that I had no labral tear in my shoulder. The sad thing is that he didn't even bother reading the report. I had to get a copy of the report from the Lexington diagnostics center because I didn't feel like his diagnosis was correct. The report showed that I had a tear in my long head tendon of biceps and no labral tear whatsoever. I'm very disappointed in the way he handled my shoulder injury. He even offered me to perform surgery to repair the labram if the pain doesn't go away when my labram was just fine. Dr. Hester is a very careless doctor and I would not recommend him to anybody.

I would not recommend Dr. Freeman. She was my OB two years ago. I had a condition called Placenta Acreta and she did not catch it. She was not on call the day my baby was born so I had to have the baby delivered by her partner at the time Dr. Goodrich. Dr. Goodrich manually removed the placenta after the birth. After I hemmoraghed the nurses thought that I probably still had placenta in me. The next day when I met with Dr. Freeman I told her what the nurses had said and she told me that she was certain that Dr. Goodrich had gotten all of the placenta out. She did not check. She could have done a quick ultrasound to be sure but she did not. The next two weeks at home I had many things happening that caused me great concern. I was having very large clots and my blood pressure (which had been high in pregnancy) did not return to normal. I called her several times but she showed no concern. Finally she suggested that I make an appointment in a couple weeks so she could take a look. That was far too late. Exactly two weeks after the birth of my baby I hemorrhaged at home (scary experience) and had to be rushed to the ER where I needed many blood transfusions. With a quick ultrasound they found I did have placenta still inside. I lost a lot of blood before I was able to get the hysterectomy that saved my life (all done by a different doctor). In my prenatal care Dr. Freeman was very caring and I felt she was very cautious. I trusted her and she let me down. I highly recommend you find a different OB.

I have been seeing Dr. Drake for 19 years. He has seen me through numerous test and operations. He is the best Gastro I have ever been under the care of. He knows his stuff and listens better then any other Doctor I've had. Having been sick with Crohns for several decades it is great to have a doctor that recognizes that patients can also be pretty good doctors. If you're with Kaiser and have digestive problems insist on seeing him!

I can't say enough positive things about Dr Michael Chang. I've seen him many times and his bedside manner is always phenomenal. He truly cares about his patients. Many doctors I've seen before (not at this office) make you feel like they're trying to get you out the door as quickly as possible to move on to the next but Dr Chang really listens. He seems very enthusiastic about truly helping and getting to the root of issues. On occasions when I've called with a question - he's called back quickly. When I was referred to physical therapy - he called me a few weeks later to see how it was going. When I call asking for a repeat prescription - it's handled within minutes. His assistant (I think his name is Ricardo?) is also excellent and very efficient. Can't say enough good things.....

It has been three months and I have left numerous messages for the doctor and staff and no one could care less.

Dr. Kurkjian with the same practice was excellent. Guess she should get trained or take lessons from her coworkers.

I had totaly negative experience. Not impresset after I checket his credentials( I wish I did before I went to him) and he list himsef as a plastic surgen when he is not. I would not go for the second time to him! There are excellent ENT physicians on the are with excellent credential and not with mony maker attidude like him!

My husband is a chronic pain patient. Not only did Dr. lewis take away his pain medication. He basically treats him like a drug addict. He keeps saying pain meds aren't a long term solution but they have no long term solution. So my husband is in constant pain and gets no relief. The nurses never call back and when they do they just yell at you. I do not recommend this doctor for anything. Find a different doctor especially if you are a chronic pain patient.

This man is a menace to society and a very dangerous person. He was my 93 year old mother in laws doctor. She recently fell and was complaining of her hip hurting. She didnt want to go to the hospital so we took her in to see Dr. Broadway. He gave her pain pills and told her if it was still hurting in a week come back and he would send her for xrays. We decided to take her to another doctor for a second opinion. The other doctor xrayed her hip immediately and it was broken. I quit using Dr. Broadway last fall because he refused to xray me and it turned out my hip was bone on bone and he just kept feeding me steroids even though my weight was becoming a problem with my mobility. He needs to have his license revoked.

"Do NOT have your baby here! Worst experience ever. I had my second child here back in February. I had to be induced because I was a week past my due date. My triage check in nurse was awesome (she gets the star along with the nice room) she told me to get the epidural right away since I was already at 4cm and thought the baby would come quick. Check into my delivery room and ask for it and the nurse told me no I had to wait because she wants to see how I contract. About an hour went by and contractions get crazy strong and so I said ok I'm ready to get the epidural. She made one call and said the anesthesiologist was busy. Contractions getting worse I demand she call again. She made 2 calls and said they were both busy. ""You kidding me""??!! What if I needed to have a emergency C section? There would be no one available to help me so I would have to feel being cut open? After my husband and I both demanded to get someone up here it was too late. I had to deliver the baby. Then comes this little girl who looks 10 years younger than me who's going to deliver my baby. She was totally new because she had another person guiding her and telling her what to do.on top of that there were 20 effing nurses in my room watching !!! I felt like a god damn science experiment. The two women who delivered me were rude and very unkind. I was NOT ok at all with anything that happened and I'm figuring out how I can go after Kaiser for it. Plus my body was so weak and tired from the pain and from not being able to eat I fainted when they tried to get me up to go to the bathroom. I was scared my body had gone through too much that if I fell asleep I wasn't going to wake up. Blood pressure was lowest of lows 66/22 something crazy like that according to my husband. Something felt absolutely wrong and fishy about why I couldn't get that epidural. I talked to my friends who are in the medical field and they don't agree with the whole thing. I delivered my first son at kaiser Fontana! Wonderful experience and only one doctor and nurse in the room that time.... Not a whole effing circus of nursing staff."

I have struggled with this doctor though reading the many positive reviews I can see where others may have a good experience. I think if your a patient who is more complicated you will encounter an arrogance like one of the other reviewers mentioned. The thing that is difficult for me is I do not feel like my own voice is heard. She will tell me I should take a medication and when I clearly say I am uncomftable with it the plan does not change and I am left without alternative options. If you are a patient who is okay with a doctor choosing things for you and you do not have an opinion on treatment options or concerns than I can see where Dr. Elliott would be an good doctor. If you want to have a voice in your own care in my experience you may find that Dr. Elliott is unwilling to change her plan to listen to your concerns or feeling about treatment options.

Medical staff walked into room never looking up at me before startinf accusations I was drug seeking. I was never given a PHYSICAL exam. He neve laid on finger on me. Never asked comprehensive history. Never treated for pain PRIOR to xrays Never offered any form of comfort like pillow blanket or kind word by ED staff. Told xrays were negative I was fine than laid waiting for discharge after 45 minutes Husband assisted me out ( unalbe to bear weight in r leg) no one even noticed us as we were leaving. Went to doctora office. Was examined by 2 Doctors and it was determined I have bulging disk in back. Pain magt came in form of lidocaine and steroid shots. Horrible experience mentally and physically. Cried when doctors at office diagnosis came relieved some one listened and cared. I had waited 24 hrs prior to coming to ED. I came in desperation for help and was mistreated bullied and accused falsely of drug seeking On good note xray tech was kind and helpful.

wow a lot of stories sound like mine back in 2002. She delivered my baby. She was not punctual. I remembered she was going to be in a race or something and would chat on her cell phone about it during my extremely short and rushed doctor visits. The staff was rude. I over heard them talking about me in Spanish because I was presumably so young. (I was 21 at the time) The nurse practitioner laughed at me when I told her my last period had only lasted a few hours so I wasn't sure if that counted. It turns out it didn't bc I delivered almost a month early and I always felt farther along than they told me. The delivery was awful. She was there for a few minutes- my water had been broken for 17 hours. The nurse who was pregnant herself was extremely mean. I had vomited in my oxygen mask and she refused to change it. I switched drs the 2nd time but her husband helped w/my C-section. I recall he was rude and I guess bc he's Jewish complained about the hospital's x-mas music the whole time.

I have been coming here for the last few months for pregnancy check ups. The waiting times are just horrible. I have never been seen in less than hour. I have also been asked to wait in the exam room half naked and needed to wait sometimes over 30min with no one coming in to inform me of a delay. Sometimes by the way the doctor doesn't actually do any vaginal examination and the nurse will still ask me to undress.If I was in the beginning of my search for a doctor I would recommend not coming here . I understand that sometimes delays happen to doctors but given that delay is thenorm here no matter if you come in early or late in the day this means there is some failure in the way the staff schedules appointments . If you value your time you will find a different place.

A misdiagnosis from dr. Sivalingam almost cost me my life. I would recommend any other doctor in the northern Virginia area except for her. While in the office she treated me like I was unimportant and she needed to get through with me so she could move on to the next patient. She quickly diagnosed a swollen rash on my face through visual means and then prescribed me two very strong antibiotics. Other doctors have said it is absurd to put these two antibiotics together for any reason. A week after I started taking the medications she has prescribed me I was admitted to the burn unit and ICU at UVA medical hospital due to Stevens-Johnson syndrome. This ordeal cost me a month in the hospital and almost took my life. I will never be the same again and will forever live with the physical and emotional scars of Rukmani Sivilingam's horrible decisions and uneducated diagnosis. Please take it from me and choose any other doctor besides her.

Thank goodness for open enrollment and goodbye to kaiser!!!! It's such a headache to try and contact the doctor. First call the 800 number then the appointment line then wait until someone calls you back. If it's anywhere near 5pm forget it they have left the building. If your appointment takes too long expect them to cut it short because they have more patients (dr lee at Carlsbad I had to chase the other doctor at San Marcos I to the hallway because he just left!) to see on their panel and wait to book another one and pay another copy. I have an ongoing condition and asked to see a specialist it took dr. karimi about three more hospital stays and me lighting up every doctor I came into contact to finally have a doctor from Zion recommend me. No worries just 100 dollars every hospital stay not to mention leaving my 5 yr old at home because karimi was too scared to make a call. I've had to fight for my healthcare and still have been running around in circles. Good luck if you choose them hopefully you won't have an ongoing condition. I will say this the only reason I have kaiser another chance this past yr was dr Chelsea Forbes she is my daughters doctor and is absolutely amazing!!!!! We are going to miss her she is patient thorough and kind. Ty dr forbes and if u ever leave kaiser we would follow in a heart beat!

Well then I called saying the fever is REALLY HIGH almost 106 and there like well - fever is good (like are you for real?) My child is crying so much about headaches for the last 6 days and your advice is to give her Advil and Tylenol every 3 hours. I have GONE THROUGH a BOTTLE OF EACH and still she isn't getting better in fact worse. So I called in the afternoon to see what I can do they tell me to keep giving Advil and Tylenol. So in the evening I am at my wits end so I call into the office and Dr. ABEL tells me on the phone "" its our policy"" not to give antibiotic over the phone but for me to take her to after hour care.

I have only been given appointments after dozens of calls and then escalating to a supervisor or member services.

I'm still waiting for a 4 week followup appointment and it has been exactly 7 weeks since surgery.

This doctor is the worst. I felt like she rushed me out. I called her office to get plan b prescribed to me and they never got back to me. They don't validate parking and I would not pay just to go see a doctor that my insurance is already paying. She really should validate for her patients. Out of basic courtesy. Her office staff is unprofessional and she is as well. She even judged me for taking certain medication saying that I should be off of it. And comparing me to a client that takes the medication I take and is now a heroin addict. What is that supposed to mean? I wouldn't recommend coming here.

I was a patient of Dr. Nudelman @ Kaiser Culver Marina for about a decade. When I first became a patient of his. He was at first very kind and helpful and understanding. About 3 months ago I changed to another Kaiser doctor. I felt Dr. Nudelman was not interested in me any longer as a patient. He would not answer my health related questions and in some cases would not refer me to other Kaiser doctors. If you are a Kaiser patient of Dr. Nudelman and are having problems; I suggest you contact Member Service and request a different doctor.

When a doctor starts examining the wrong body part and then argues with you that you are incorrect you should run quickly. My husband suffered from post surgical blood clots and when we went for a follow up visit they tech started examining the wrong leg. They insisted I was wrong and then tried to cover is up saying both legs were to be examined. This was from a WC case and we at the time did not have personal insurance. Dr Kwon harassed me for not having private insurance coverage and that he expects us to have it straightened out when we come for a follow up. Not sure why he cared he was being paid either way but her was a real a**hat and completely unprofessional. Never ever again. I will gladly drive to RWJ in New Brunswick to avoid this clown.

He operated on me several times during my pregnancies allowing my husband and I to complete our family.

Turns out she only works a few days out of the week. Helpful right? Well I told her about my endometriosis and how I needed a consult because I'm 21 and I don't know how to proceed with treating it. I also informed her of my low income situation. She proceeded to tell me to take a medicine that cost $200 twice a year and when I said I couldn't afford it she stopped refilling the free prescription I had been getting for years. When I tried to contact the office after that happened because of the amount of pain I was in for not being treated. It took 2 WEEKS to get someone to actually answer when I called and to refill the script. The entire office is unprofessional and they see you as just a big bag of cash.

My name is Brandon Roberts and I have a pituitary adenoma. I have had significant health problems as a result over the last few years. As a result I have interacted with many great doctors and I have never written a negative review about anyone. In fact I've written three positive reviews. What I think makes a great doctor is someone who respects his patients. I did not feel respected in my single interaction with Dr. Alexander's office. In fact I felt completely disrespected.I got hopelessly lost trying to find his office and showed up 10 minutes late. I had arrived in the area 20 minutes before the appointment... but there were 10 different hospital buildings in the same area. Respect goes both ways so I would have been totally fine with them saying I'm sorry but you need to wait however long to see the doctor... instead they said they wouldn't see me that day. No one asked me how far I had driven to get there (45 minutes) or how serious my condition was (I had a seizure which put me in the ER earlier in the week) they just said he was too busy. I've never had that experience in my life - despite hundreds of doctors appointments. I understand you are busy... but respect means that you should also understand that your patients are busy. I wasted over 2 hours of my life between driving and trying to find your office... I assume you don't have that much time to waste and I know that I don't... a respectful person would have put themselves in their patient's shoes. I'm sure he's a great medical doctor... but being a good doctor is also about respect. If this is a mistake and you do respect your patients then I'll be waiting for a call to explain.

She is pretty young and has just had a baby herself so it's always so easy to talk to her; you almost don't feel like you are dealing with a Dr. as much as you are a friend but she also definitely knows what she is talking about.  She even did 3 FREE EXTRA SONOGRAMS for me (you're only supposed to get one that insurance covers) just so I could see how my baby was progressing!  So SO mazing. You wont find a better OBGYN!!!!

Horrible. They need to fine tune communication or quiz employees to make sure they know how to do their job.

I was told I had chest pain and ultimately learned I had a blockage in my artery. I have come to find that Dr. Cambier and his practice have been pioners in new technology like absorbing heart stents and devices to strengthen hearts that are weak. Very impressive. Highly recommended.

All went very well with my first appointment with Dr. Belknap. Felt very much at ease and he was very pleasant to talk to.

I was told I had bladder cancer without ever being tested for it. Then sent to a specialist who determined I didn't have it after testing but told for a fee of $5000 I could be DNA tested to see if I had the gene. I was have Pap test done by her and told I had HPV then later found out through a real gynocologist that I did not have it. Was told I had a hot appendix and to just go home and if I started to run a high fever to just go to the emergency room. I was given multiple psychological drugs which caused my problem to worsen because I started having suicidal thoughts and over dosed on the meds she prescribed for depression. Then over a $600 dollar bill owed to her but because of the psychological drugs wasn't able to work to earn the money to pay her bill I was told I could no longer come back to the facility and be seen by her or any other doctors in that facility again. In my own opinion she is not a good doctor in any way. Creates issues that are not there and the ones you do have are not treated with expertise. A really good doctor to see is Doctor Amy Miller she all about you and your health and working to help resolve your health issues and she doesn't believe in prescribing meds unless there is no other alternative. Great Doctor. I would not recommend Dr. Day to anyone. Just my opinion!

I have had a great experience with Dr. Liang. She has been available when I need an appointment and has called me to follow up on my condition when I had a wasp sting. I find she is caring and connected with me.

Severed my main artery in left leg during surgery that led to 9 hour vascular bypass surgery. I will likely lose my leg as a result of his negligence.

Dr. Kruger has been my OB since two years ago. I just have good comments about her. She delivered my baby and as FTM all I can say it was a magical experience. She really listens and try to give you a solution.

Dr. Hostin and his team did an excellent job in treating my scoliosis. At the time of my surgery I was a 59 years old male with a curve >120 degrees. The outcome exceeded expectations. Give Dr. Hostin a chance to help with your scoliosis if you feel the future is bleak. Prior to my first visit to Southwest Scoliosis Institute I was skeptical that my scoliosis could be significantly improved. My skepticism was eliminated very quickly as I worked with Dr. Hostin and his staff.

Dr. Bass was very professional and his staff was also very courteous. I did have a bit of a wait but overall my experience was pleasant
